# compiled binaries expose CLI args via [Environment]::GetCommandLineArgs()

#
# --reattach: passed by DuneShell.exe when IT self-started us because a
# taskbar-pinned/standalone launch found no backend running at all (see
# MainForm.TryStartBackendAsync). That DuneShell process is the one the user
# is looking at and is already polling last-url.txt for the fresh URL we're

# ---------- Minimize own console window IMMEDIATELY ----------------------------
# v6.1.7+: the EXE is built console-subsystem (NoConsole=$false in Build-Exe.ps1)
# so that child kubectl/ssh/git processes inherit a console and Windows doesn't
# allocate a flashy new console window for each one (the "popup window flash"
# users saw on every dashboard refresh in v6.1.2-v6.1.6). We don't actually
# want the console visible, so minimize it as the very first action.
#
# Detection rule: process name is the compiled EXE name (e.g. "DuneServer")
# when launched as the ps2exe build. When the script runs as plain .ps1
# inside an existing pwsh/powershell session, the process name is
# "pwsh" / "powershell" — leave that console alone (it's the user's working shell).
#
# v6.1.7 hotfix: the previous `GetConsoleProcessList(count==1)` guard turned
# out to skip the minimize whenever the installer / auto-updater that
# launched the EXE was still attached to the same console at startup
# (count > 1), leaving the window full-size. Process-name detection is
# reliable in all those cases.
