# Copilot / AI agent instructions — DST (Dune Server Tool)

Authoritative, repo-local guidance for AI agents working on this repository.
**Everything an agent needs lives in this repo — do not rely on machine-local
notes, chat transcripts, or paths outside the checkout.** If a rule is missing
here, add it here in the same change.

## What DST is (orientation)

DST (Dune Server Tool) is a **Windows admin application for running a private
*Dune: Awakening* dedicated server**. It is three parts that ship as one
installer: a **PowerShell backend** (`app/server`, compiled to `DuneServer.exe`)
exposing a localhost HTTP API, a **React + TypeScript web UI** (`webui`) served
to a **WebView2 desktop shell** (`app/desktop/DuneShell`), plus a top-level
launcher (`dune-server.ps1`). It manages the game server VM, its Postgres game
DB, game/INI config, and live gameplay admin (players, items, storage, specs,
Landsraad, market bot). The repo `coastal-ms/DST-DuneServerTool` is public and
forkable. Day-to-day work is: reproduce a reported bug, fix it across the
PS backend + webui, build the installer, ship a release.

## Work orchestration — do the work in-session

Apply this in **every session**, unless the maintainer explicitly asks otherwise:

- **Do the work in the session you are in.** Decompose the goal into the session
  `todos` table (and `todo_deps` for ordering) when that helps you keep track,
  but write the implementation yourself. There is no planner/builder split and
  no separate "executor" role — do not narrate one.
- **Child sessions and sub-agents are allowed for bounded independent work or
  separate context.** The parent session remains the sole
  user-facing coordinator and owns approval gates. Every child reports results,
  progress, blockers, and questions to the parent instead of asking the
  maintainer directly. Automatically started children follow the same rule.
  Children inherit the parent session's active model; never select a different
  model. Do not recreate a planner/builder split.
- **Discord monitoring belongs to the active parent, never a child responder.**
  Attach the parent to the persistent local gateway ears-only, batch/deduplicate
  startup catch-up, and get one maintainer decision before live autonomy.
  Event delivery is ID-only, ACKed, and wakes the same parent through one
  detached wait. Fetch actual context before ACK; rearm only after pending is
  clear. Live conversation scope is harmless banter plus useful Dune-related
  conversation, including open questions that do not mention Duke.
  Coastal alone has full local control; elevated Hawk may request bounded,
  backup-safe local Dune-server work only. Gateway autonomy never performs
  destructive work. Normal wait renewal does not re-gate.
- **All troubleshooting threads are private by default.** Invite only the
  reporter, Coastal, and Duke. The shared-channel redirect must explicitly say
  **PRIVATE thread** and include its clickable channel mention. Create any useful
  public FAQ only afterward from separately sanitized facts.

## Repository layout

- `app/server/` — PowerShell backend: `lib/` (business logic) + `routes/` (HTTP API).
- `app/DuneServer.ps1` — backend entrypoint; compiled to `DuneServer.exe` via PS2EXE.
- `app/build/Build-Exe.ps1` — builds `app/build/output/DuneServer.exe`.
- `app/installer/` — Inno Setup script (`DuneServer.iss`) + `Build-Installer.ps1`.
- `app/desktop/DuneShell/` — WebView2 desktop shell (.NET).
- `webui/` — React + TypeScript SPA (Vite). Built into `webui/dist/`.
- `dune-server.ps1` — top-level launcher.

## Building & testing — where the test build goes

Build the full installer with:

```powershell
pwsh app/installer/Build-Installer.ps1
```

Output (the artifact to install/test) is always:

```
app/installer/output/DuneServerSetup.exe
```

**Install and test from that path.** Do not scatter test builds into other
folders.

When you are working inside a **git worktree** (the CLI creates per-session
worktrees), the build lands in *that worktree's* `app/installer/output/`. The
maintainer installs/tests from the **primary checkout** instead, so after a
successful build **copy the resulting `DuneServerSetup.exe` into the primary
checkout's `app/installer/output/`** so it is in the expected, stable location.
Your session context exposes the primary checkout as `main_checkout_path`; the
target is `<main_checkout_path>/app/installer/output/DuneServerSetup.exe`. Never
deploy test builds anywhere else.

Fast inner-loop checks (no full build):

```powershell
# PowerShell parse-check a script:
pwsh -NoProfile -Command "[void][System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile('app/server/lib/Foo.ps1',[ref]$null,[ref]([System.Management.Automation.Language.ParseError[]]@()))"
# Web UI build + typecheck:
cd webui; npm run build
```

A session worktree may not have warm `webui/node_modules` — run `npm ci` in
`webui/` first if the build can't resolve modules.

## Encoding rules (these break the build / runtime if ignored)

- **`.ps1` files that contain any non-ASCII byte MUST be saved UTF-8 *with BOM*.**
  `DuneServer.exe` is compiled with PS2EXE, whose Windows PowerShell 5.1 host
  decodes BOM-less files as Windows-1252 and mojibakes em-dashes / arrows /
  box-drawing — which has broken startup before. `Build-Installer.ps1` has a
  pre-flight that fails the build if a bundled `.ps1` has non-ASCII bytes and no
  BOM. To fix: prepend bytes `EF BB BF`.
- Source files use **LF** line endings (see `.gitattributes`). Use plain
  `git add` (the repo's `core.autocrlf` normalization handles it); never stage
  with `core.autocrlf=false`, which bakes CRLF into the blob and causes
  whole-file diffs/merge conflicts. Note: adding/removing a BOM is a content
  change, not an EOL change, and is preserved through normal `git add`.

## Versioning & releases

- The release version is stamped in **five** files that must always match:
  1. `app/DuneServer.ps1` — `$script:DuneToolVersion`
  2. `app/build/Build-Exe.ps1` — default `$Version`
  3. `app/desktop/DuneShell/DuneShell.csproj` — `<Version>`
  4. `app/installer/DuneServer.iss` — `#define MyAppVersion`
  5. `dune-server.ps1` — `$script:ToolVersion`
  `Build-Installer.ps1` aborts if they disagree (override only with
  `-SkipVersionCheck` for deliberate intermediate builds).
- Roll the `## [Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` into a dated
  `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` entry as part of the release change.
- **Framework-only release notes.** When a change is designated a
  `framework adjustment`, use only that phrase in `CHANGELOG.md`, GitHub release
  notes, and other release-facing summaries. Do not identify the underlying
  records, entities, or implementation details there; source data remains
  authoritative.
- **Stable/test release surfaces.** Stable is always the primary/default install.
  During an active test cycle, app and website release selectors show the stable
  release plus only the newest and immediately previous test builds. Outside an
  active test cycle, publish the stable bits as the `test1` mirror so users who
  remain on the Test channel are not stranded. GitHub Releases-page cleanup is
  separate and manual-only: never delete releases or tags unless the maintainer
  explicitly calls for that cleanup.
- **Every GitHub release MUST attach `DuneServerSetup.exe` as its sole asset.**
  Code-only releases break the in-app updater (it gates on an asset being
  present and silently reports "up to date"). After publishing, verify with
  `gh release view vX.Y.Z --json assets`.
- **Release assets are immutable.** Never upload or replace an asset on an
  existing release; any correction gets a new version and tag so checksums and
  tester reports remain trustworthy.
- **Every release, refresh the bug-report issue template.** When a release adds
  or changes user-facing features, update
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` so bug reports and the log-gathering
  guidance cover the new surfaces: add/adjust the **"Where did the bug happen?"**
  dropdown options, the **"Specific page / button"** examples, and any
  per-feature diagnostic section (e.g. Give Item/Kit, Game Config / Landsraad,
  Cheat Scripts). Bump the `tool_version` placeholder to the new version. This
  keeps diagnostics actionable so a hotfix can be triaged fast. If a new feature
  produces logs the diagnostic bundle (`app/server/routes/Diagnostics.ps1`)
  doesn't yet collect, extend the bundler too.

## Git workflow

- **Never commit directly to `main`.** Branch (`coastal-ms/<short-slug>`),
  commit, push, open a PR, and merge through GitHub. Tag releases from the merge
  commit on `main`.
- Keep changes surgical and scoped to the request.
